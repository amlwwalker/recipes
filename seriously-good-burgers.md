# Seriously Good Burgers


## Burgers

* Nice block of Butter
* Good slug fish sauce
* Good slug Worcestershire sauce
* Liquid smoke
* 0.5 kg of beef mince

Mix well, don't crush the mince too much, roll into 1.5 inch diameter balls. Chill.
When cooking get the surface (bbq or pan) hot, put the ball on the heat and press down with a spatula hard. The edges should 'smash' and will caremalise. Flip over after a minute and place cheese on other side. Cover for 1 minute so that the cheese melts.
