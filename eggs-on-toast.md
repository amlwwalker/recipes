# Poached Eggs on Toast with Sobrasada

![egg-sobrasada](images/egg-sobrasada.png)

Honestly, it's so simple and ridiculously good. I recommend buying an egg poaching pan. They are cheap and can, depending on the size poach between 4 and 16 eggs. Some people will call them cobbled eggs. Whatever, they are amazing.


## Ingredients

* Sobrasada (spanish spreadable meat paste)
* 2 eggs (per person)
* Sourdough bread
* Olive oil
* Chilli flakes
* Salt
* Pepper

## Method

* Run some olive oil all around the inside of the egg cups that go in the poacher (assuming you are using one). This stops the egg cooking and depending on how much oil you use, adds some delicious flavour. I recommend a good oil.
* sprinkle some sea salt into the cup and some chilli flakes
* Crack the egg in. 
* I recommend 2 eggs per person
* Poach for 5 minutes 35 seconds at sea level. Burford Brown eggs are best, whiter/paler yolks take slightly longer.
* Meanwhile toast some sourdough slices. You want them done about a minute before your egg timer goes off.
* Now use sobrasada instead of butter. Nice thick layer. It's mind blowing
* Place the egg on top, crack some black pepper over it and if you like (I do), some chilli sauce to your liking.
