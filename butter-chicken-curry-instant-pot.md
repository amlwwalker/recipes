# Instant Pot Butter Chicken

* Can chopped tomatos
* 4-5 cloves garlic
* 2 tsp minced ginger
* teaspoon turmeric
* 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 0.5 kg boneless, skinless chicken thigh

### After the cooking

* Cilantro
* Cream
* Butter
* Garam masala

Add all the above to the instant pot in the order listed mixing before adding chicken. If chicken is frozen, gently push into the sauce. Set to 10 minutes on high pressure and release naturally for 10 minutes before quick releasing.

Remove the chicken pieces carefully. Blend the sauce at this stage. Let the sauce cool for 10 minutes (often good to take the pot out of the instant pot for this). 

Then add the cilantro cream, butter and garam masala. Add the chicken back in gently broken (you can shred it if you like).

Serve how you wish, with nicely cooked jasmine rice. There is a lot of sauce that you could re use for other dishes.
